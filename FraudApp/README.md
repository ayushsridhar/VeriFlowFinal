# VeriFlow

## Inspiration

In today's digital economy, high-value transactions require enhanced security measures to protect both merchants and consumers. Traditional payment verification methods often fall short when dealing with significant amounts, leaving vulnerabilities that can be exploited by fraudsters. We were inspired to create a comprehensive solution that combines device fingerprinting, bank verification, and multi-factor authentication to create a seamless yet secure transaction experience.

## What it does

VeriFlow is an intelligent payment verification system that dynamically adjusts security requirements based on transaction value and user verification status. The system:

- **Device Fingerprinting**: Identifies returning users through unique device characteristics
- **Plaid Integration**: Verifies bank account information for new users
- **Microsoft 2FA**: Implements push notification approval for high-value transactions (â‰¥$500)
- **Dynamic Security**: Automatically determines the appropriate verification level based on transaction amount and user history
- **Real-time Approval**: Polls for user approval via Microsoft Authenticator for enhanced security

The system provides three tiers of verification:
1. **New Users**: Complete Plaid bank verification
2. **Returning Users (Low Value)**: Instant approval for transactions under $500
3. **Returning Users (High Value)**: Microsoft Authenticator push notification approval

## How we built it

### Frontend (React.js)
- **React Components**: Built with modern React hooks and functional components
- **Plaid Link Integration**: Seamless bank account verification using `react-plaid-link`
- **Microsoft Authentication**: MSAL.js integration for Microsoft 2FA
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Client-side fingerprinting for user identification
- **Real-time Polling**: Frontend polling mechanism for approval status updates

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **Express.js API**: RESTful endpoints for all system operations
- **MongoDB Integration**: User data storage and transaction tracking
- **Plaid API**: Server-side integration for bank verification
- **Microsoft Graph API**: Push notification system for transaction approval
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation between authentication, verification, and approval services

### Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, CSS3
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **APIs**: Plaid API, Microsoft Graph API
- **Authentication**: MSAL.js, Microsoft Authenticator
- **Security**: Device fingerprinting, SSL/TLS encryption

## Challenges we ran into

### Technical Challenges
- **MongoDB Connection Issues**: Persistent SSL errors and server selection timeouts required careful configuration and debugging
- **Port Mismatches**: Frontend and backend communication issues due to inconsistent port configurations
- **Microsoft Auth Token Storage**: Complex token management and storage for push notification functionality
- **User Query Logic**: Ensuring accurate user identification across multiple credit cards and device fingerprints
- **Real-time Polling**: Implementing efficient frontend polling without overwhelming the server

### Integration Challenges
- **Plaid API Complexity**: Managing link tokens, public tokens, and access tokens across the authentication flow
- **Microsoft 2FA Flow**: Coordinating between frontend authentication prompts and backend approval systems
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Ensuring device fingerprinting works consistently across different browsers
- **State Management**: Handling complex state transitions between verification, authentication, and approval phases

### Database Design
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Preventing duplicate user entries with the same device fingerprint and credit card
- **Microsoft Linking**: Properly associating Microsoft authentication data with specific user profiles
- **Transaction Tracking**: Managing approval requests and their expiration times

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- **Seamless User Experience**: Created a frictionless verification process that adapts to user needs
- **Robust Security**: Implemented multi-layered security with device fingerprinting, bank verification, and 2FA
- **Real-time Approval**: Built a responsive approval system with frontend polling and backend status management
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed a modular system that can easily accommodate new verification methods
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and debugging throughout the application
- **Clean Code**: Maintainable codebase with clear separation of concerns and extensive logging

## What we learned

### Technical Insights
- **API Integration**: Deep understanding of Plaid's authentication flow and token management
- **Microsoft Graph**: Learned to implement push notifications and approval workflows using Microsoft's APIs
- **MongoDB Best Practices**: Gained experience with connection management, query optimization, and data modeling
- **Frontend-Backend Communication**: Mastered real-time communication patterns and state synchronization

### Development Process
- **Iterative Development**: The importance of building and testing incrementally
- **Debugging Strategies**: Effective use of logging and debugging tools for complex systems
- **User Experience Design**: Balancing security requirements with user convenience
- **Error Recovery**: Implementing graceful error handling and user feedback mechanisms

### Security Considerations
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Understanding when and how to implement additional security layers
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Learning the balance between security and privacy in user identification
- **Token Management**: Proper handling of sensitive authentication tokens and refresh mechanisms
